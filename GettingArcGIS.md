# ArcGIS Desktop & ArcGIS Pro Software

ArcGIS Desktop and ArcGIS Pro are now available for download to any Stanford student, staff, faculty, or sponsored affiliate (with a valid SUnet ID), and we are simplifying the process of installing and authorizing the software.  

The Stanford Geospatial Center maintains a set of "Installation Batch Files" that can be used to automate the process of installing and authorizing ArcGIS Desktop and ArcGIS Pro. You can download those installers by logging into Box.com using your Stanford credentials, and going to: [https://stanford.box.com/v/EsriSoftwareInstallers](https://stanford.box.com/v/EsriSoftwareInstallers). 

64-bit Windows users should be able to:

1. Download the zipped installation files for the desired software (ArcGIS Desktop and Pro are currently available).  
2. Unzip the installers to the machine you want to install to (Right-click>Extract...).  
3. Browse into the unzipped folder, right-click on the *.bat file and "Run  as Administrator"  
4. Installation typically takes several minutes, and should proceed, unattended. 

Students interested in using Esri software on a Mac should contact Student Tech Services at Lathrop ([https://thehub.stanford.edu/](https://thehub.stanford.edu/)), for assistance obtaining and installing a Windows OS Virtual Machine on their device. Faculty and Staff will need to contact their respective technical support staff for assistance with Windows virtualization. Once you have a working Windows VM, the above installers and instructions should work.

If you require versions of Esri software, other than the most recent release, please feel free to contact [maples@stanford.edu](mailto:maples@stanford.edu?subject=Esri%20Software%20Access%20at%20Stanford) with your request.

Note: for installation on Stanford affiliated computers only and only to users who possess a valid SUNet ID. Software and data provided under this agreement are to be used for instruction, research, and administrative purposes only. Use of the licensed programs for profit, private gain, or other commercial use is prohibited.
