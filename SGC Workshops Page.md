* What is GIS?  
* Spatial Data Models and Formats  
* Projections and Coordinate Systems  
* Basic Data Management  
* The ArcMap User Interface   
* Simple Analysis using Visualization.

This session builds upon the skills and concepts introduced in the "Introduction to GIS with ArcGIS Desktop" session and participants will be expected to attend that workshop, or have comparable experience with ArcGIS 10.2. Topics include:  

* Use of Relates & Relationship Classes  
* Geoprocessing of geographic data  
* Geocoding of street addresses  
* Overlay Analysis  
* Advanced Manipulation of Tabular Data

This workshop serves as follow-on to the Introductory and Geoprocessing Skills workshops.   Some level of familiarity with ArcGIS is assumed.  In this exercise you will use the goal of producing a publication quality map of sugar plantations in Madagascar as the vehicle for introducing some of the more advanced skills necessary to have when working on extensive GIS projects. Topics include:  

* Creation and management of File Geodatabases.  
* Conversion of XY coordinates data to a Geodatabase feature class.  
* Creating Custom ArcToolbox Geoprocessing Tools using ModelBuilder  
* Georeferencing of scanned map images  
* Creation and editing of Geodatabase Feature Classes  
* Using Definition Queries  
* Working with Annotation Classes  
* Managing Multiple Data Frames  
* Customizing Map Elements  
* Using Extent Rectangles to link Data Frames

## Raster! The 'Other' GIS data.

The Raster Data Model provides an effective means of characterizing spatially continuous phenomena, such as elevation, temperature, precipitation and other environmental and climatic characteristics. This workshop provides a targeted introduction to the tools available in ArcGIS for creating, managing and analyzing data in raster form. Topics include:   

* Types of Raster Data  
* Properties of Raster Data  
* Symbolization & Display of Raster Data  
* Imagery Analysis in ArcGIS 
* Terrain Analysis in ArcGIS 
* The Spatial Analyst Toolset  
* Extracting Data from Raster to Vector  
* Map Algebra
