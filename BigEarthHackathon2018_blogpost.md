# The Stanford Geospatial Center helps Stanford students "Hack the Big Earth"

On April 14th and 15th, the [Stanford Geospatial Center](https://gis.stanford.edu) (SGC) joined with faculty and staff from the [Stanford School of Earth, Energy and Environment](https://earth.stanford.edu/),  developers and data scientists from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/), [Planet Labs](https://www.planet.com/), [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/), [Satellogic](https://www.satellogic.com/) and [more](https://bigearthhacks.stanford.edu/tools), to mentor Stanford graduate and undergraduate students during the Stanford School of Earth Energy and Environment's [[Big Earth Hackathon](https://bigearthhacks.stanford.edu/)](https://bigearthhacks.stanford.edu/). 

Over a 36 hour sprint, held across three locations on campus, 100 Stanford students broke into teams of 4 or fewer and tackled problems ranging from food security to Earth process monitoring with the [fiber optic lines underneath Stanford University](https://bigearthhacks.stanford.edu/project-topics/seismic-vibrations). Participants were given free and broad access to a number of "Big Earth" data sources, platforms and resources, including Planet.com's daily imaging of the entire Earth [[https://www.planet.com/explorer](https://www.planet.com/explorer)], Satellogic's growing constellation of [hyperspectral](https://www.satellogic.com/commitment-to-science) micro satellites and [Stanford's own Fiber Optics network](https://news.stanford.edu/2017/10/19/building-billion-sensors-quake-monitor-optical-fibers/).  

Participants included students from across Stanford, including many from the Schools of Engineering, Earth Energy and Environment, Humanities and Medicine. 

The SGC's Geospatial Manager, Stace Maples, helped to find and coordinate mentors before the event and then helped participants find and leverage geospatial tools to make use of the data at their disposal, during the hackathon. When all was done and coding came to a halt, Maples had the additional task of acting as a judge for the final projects, which turned out to be the most difficult of all!  

Winning projects included examinations of the [Environmental impacts of the Rohingya refugee crisis in Bangladesh](https://devpost.com/software/environmental-impacts-of-the-rohingya-refugee-crisis), [Machine learning for identification of building damage from satellite imagery](https://devpost.com/software/building-damage-assessment-using-satellite-imagery) and a [routing application sensitive to local flooding events predicted from machine learning](https://devpost.com/software/earthflow). 

[Satellogic](https://www.satellogic.com/), currently the only publicly available vendor of hyperpectral Earth imaging data, gets special mention for providing what must be the coolest Hackathon prize in history. For her work on [Removing clouds from Satellogic's hyperspectral imagery](https://devpost.com/software/kumo-san), Stanford PhD student, Laura Domine, will get to task one of Satellogic's satellite's to capture an hyperspectral image of any place on Earth! 

You can find [all 13 of the final team submissions](https://bigearthhacks.devpost.com/submissions) and the winning presentations, code and more on the [Big Earth Hackathon Devpost site](https://bigearthhacks.devpost.com/). 

Data scientists and developers from Planet.com will return to Stanford on April 24th to teach "**An Introduction to Planet.com's Daily Earth Imaging for Ice, Snow and Cryosphere Applications.**" (RSVP on [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/imaging-ice-with-planetcom-an-introduction-to-planetcoms-daily-earth-imaging-for-ice-snow-and-tickets-45120654091)), part of the "[Understanding Ice: The James B. Case Memorial Symposium](https://events.stanford.edu/events/756/75605/)" at [The David Rumsey Map Center](http://library.stanford.edu/rumsey), in Stanford's Green Library.
