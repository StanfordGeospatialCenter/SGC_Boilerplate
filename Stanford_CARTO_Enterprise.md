# Creating an Account on Stanford's CARTO.com Enterprise account

The Stanford Geospatial Center maintains an Enterprise account on CARTO.com for the use of Stanford researchers in creating performant, API-based data-driven web applications.

Using the Stanford Geospatial Center's CARTO.com Enterprise account provides you with a number of benefits, including:
* Increased amount of data storage (250MB)
* Remote data syncing through Google Drive, Dropbox and other services (have CARTO check your source dataset periodically and update with any new data!)
* User Groups for managing collaborative projects


To create a CARTO.com user on our enterprise account:

* Go to [https://stanford.carto.com/signup](https://stanford.carto.com/signup)
* Use your stanford.edu email address to create a new user.

(Note that is you have previously created a carto.com user wth your stanford.edu email address, you will nee dot delete that user account before you can use the same email for a new one).
