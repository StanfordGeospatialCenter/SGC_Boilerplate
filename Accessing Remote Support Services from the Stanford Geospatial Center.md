# Accessing Remote Support Services from the Stanford Geospatial Center

For the most up-to-date information on the Stanford Libraries' response to COVID-19, please see: https://library.stanford.edu/alerts

## Statement on SGC's COVID-19 response
In line with the university’s most recent updates and guidelines regarding COVID-19, the Libraries will remain open to support continued operations. As part of the Stanford Libraries system, The Stanford Geospatial Center will continue to match the opening hours of the Branner Earth Science Library (see below). However, given the fluidity of the situation, and changing directives, the Stanford Geospatial Center will begin providing as many of its support services through remote means as possible. The following guidance serves to provide information about existing and new remote support and alternative instruction options for Stanford users.

## SGC Lab Hours
The SGC computer lab will be open during regular [Branner Library hours](https://library-hours.stanford.edu/libraries/branner) the week of March 9th: Monday-Thursday from 9am-9pm and Saturday from 1-5pm.  From March 16th-March 27th, the library and the SGC will be open Monday through Friday from 9am-5pm with no weekend hours.  

Stanford Library Hours general information: https://library-hours.stanford.edu/

## SGC Workshops Cancelled  
In accordance with the University's direction to minimize in-person instruction, the Stanford Geospatial Center Workshop series has been suspended, until guidance from the Provost directs otherwise. Much of the SGC Workshop Series is designed to be self-paced, as well as instructor-led and I have provided links to those materials, as well as other high-quality instructional materials for various platforms, below.  

## Remote Support Options
### Email Support
Please use the following link to contact SGC staff for support. This link will email all SGC Support Staff, simultaneously, and the first person able to reply will get back to you as soon as possible.

### **\#stanford-geospatial-center** Slack Channel
To access the Stanford Geospatial Center's support Slack channel, first join the Stanford Communities of Practice Slack (https://stanfordcop.slack.com/), then add the **\#stanford-geospatial-center** channel. SGC Staff will monitor this channel during regular business hours, and will respond to off-hours requests at the earliest possible business hour. 

### Zoom Meetings
Wherever possible, we will be using Zoom for providing "face-to-face" support sessions. This will be the default meeting type proposed by SGC Staff, and a link to the support staff's personal "Zoom Room" will be included in the invite. If you prefer in-person meetings, please let us know when you email requesting a support consultation. For more information about Stanford's Zoom infrastructure, go to: https://stanford.zoom.us/

## Connecting to SGC Services
User who have been added to the SGC Lab Workgroup can access the materials they have saved to their R: Drive, remotely, using the following guidance. #### New GIS lab folder structure:  * R:\Users = GIS user folder, access limited to signed in user, no access to other user folders.  * Q:\Groups = group folders for collaborative work, request access from SGC staff.  * Q:\Data = Read only GIS data collection.   ### Connecting to the GIS user folder from outside the lab:Note: you must be on the Stanford network on campus or connected through [Stanford's VPN](https://uit.stanford.edu/service/vpn).  #### Windows computers  * Click on This PC to open a new File Explorer window (do NOT open Internet Explorer).  * Go to the Computer tab and select the Map Network Drive dropdown and option.  * In the window that opens set the Drive letter to P  * Set the Folder path for the User connection to **\\sul-sgclab\Users\[your SUnet username]** * Check the box for Reconnect at sign-in if you would like the drive to automatically connect every time you log on.  * Check the box for Connect using different credentials if you did not use your Stanford username and password to sign in to the computer being used (e.g. a personal laptop). If asked for your username enter it as **WIN\[your username]**  * Repeat above with **\\sul-sgclab\GIS** for the Data and Groups folder connections.  #### Mac computers  * From the Finder menu bar, click on Go and select Connect to Server…* In the top bar of the window that opens type **smb://sul-sgclab/Users/[your SUNet username]**.* Click the + sign to add this address to the Favorite Servers list.* Click the Connect button to open the server connection.* In the new dialog that opens select Registered User* In the Name field enter **WIN\ [your username]*** Fill in your password and click Connect* Repeat above with **smb://sul-sgclab/GIS** for the Data and Groups folder connections.
