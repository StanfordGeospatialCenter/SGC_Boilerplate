# Planet.com's Daily Image of the Earth

Planet.com's [Planetscope Imagery Product](https://developers.planet.com/docs/data/planetscope/) is a 3-meter resolution, multispectral image of the Earth, daily. Currently, Planetscope provides images with 8 bands of spectral data, harmonized with [Sentinel-2'](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2)s medium resolution multispectral imagery products. Planetscope imagery can be accessed through [Planet's Orders API](https://developers.planet.com/apis/orders/), the [Planet Explorer](https://developers.planet.com/docs/apps/explorer/) and [integrations with popular Desktop GIS Applications, like ArcGIS Pro and QGIS, and Google Earth Engine](https://developers.planet.com/integrations/).  To learn more about Planet.com's imagery, and how to leverage it in your research and teaching, see Planet's new [Planet University](https://university.planet.com/) resources page.

# Corelogic's U.S. Property Records

Stanford Libraries provides access to CoreLogic properties databases through the [Stanford University Data Farm](https://redivis.com/Stanford), a Redivis-based research data exploration tool for datasets, allowing for fast and highly efficient queries and extracts handled directly in the browser. 

CoreLogic provides 4 distinct datasets on properties and ownership, in the U.S.:  

* [The CoreLogic Deed Data](https://redivis.com/datasets/rz0v-1mcs4sreb) provides a snapshot of residential and commercial property ownership in U.S. states, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Washington, D.C., as of June 2019.
* [CoreLogic Tax](https://redivis.com/datasets/b29g-apdxfe01g) is Tax assessment data for all U.S. states, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and Washington, D.C., as of June 2019.
* [CoreLogic Tax History](https://redivis.com/datasets/e9sx-cn4k3cyva) provides Historical tax assessment data for all U.S. states, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and Washington, D.C. Each table represents a previous edition of CoreLogic's tax assessment data.
* [CoreLogic Pre-Foreclosure](https://redivis.com/datasets/my00-1hx3kjzzk) data documents about 30 million property transactions representing pre-foreclosure events. These transactions occurred in U.S. states (excluding Vermont), the U.S. Virgin Islands and Washington, D.C.

CoreLogic property records contain basic spatial parameters, including property centroid latitude and longitude coordinates, as well as identification ID's that can be matched to available parcel boundary databases, using an assessor's parcel number (APN), property identification number (PIN), or other common identifier's assigned to parcels of real property.
