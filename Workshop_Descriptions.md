## Google Earth Engine 101: An introduction to Earth Engine for absolute beginners  

Date: Fri, January 22, 2021  
Time: 1:30 PM â€“ 3:00 PM PST  
Venue: Zoom Workshop  

### Meet Earth Engine

[Google Earth Engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/) is a geospatial processing service. With Earth Engine, you can perform geospatial processing at scale, powered by Google Cloud Platform. The purpose of Earth Engine is to:
Provide an interactive platform for geospatial algorithm development at scale
Enable high-impact, data-driven science
Make substantive progress on global challenges that involve large geospatial datasets

Google Earth Engine combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with planetary-scale analysis capabilities and makes it available for scientists, researchers, and developers to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earth's surface.

**Presenter**: [Stace Maples](mailto:maples@stanford.edu)
_Please note that this workshop is for Stanford University affiliates, only._

**Description**: The Earth Engine API (application programming interface) provides the ability to create your own algorithms to process raster and vector imagery. This session is geared toward people who would like to analyze satellite and vector data. The session will be hands-on, using the Earth Engine Javascript code editor.

The first part of the class will be an overview of the Google Earth Engine Platform, and Remote Sensing, in general. The second half will focus on accessing imagery, creating composites, and running analyses over stacks of images, computing statistics on imagery, creating charts and exporting the results of your analyses.

**Prerequisites**: No previous experience with Earth Engine or JavaScript is necessary for the beginner workshop, but programming experience, basic knowledge of remote sensing and/or GIS are highly desirable. Willingness to learn programming is required. Participants with no programming experience will require additional attention.
