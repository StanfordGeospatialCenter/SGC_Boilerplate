## Borrowing licenses from the ArcGIS License Server

1. In the ArcGIS Program Group, find and launch the ArcGIS Administrator application (be sure no ArcGIS components are currently running).  
2. In ArcGIS Administrator, select the desired product folder (Desktop or Engine) in the table of contents for which you want to borrow licenses.  
2. Make sure the license manager has been defined.  
3. Select the **Borrow/Return folder**.  
4. Check the boxes of the features you want to borrow (typically all of them) and click Apply.  
5. After the licenses have been borrowed, click OK to close the ArcGIS Administrator.

You can now use your ArcGIS software while off the network.
