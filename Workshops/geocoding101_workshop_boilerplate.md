Geocoding is the process of using of reference datasets (such as street networks, administrative boundaries and gazetteers) to convert text-based locations (such as street addresses, administrative unit codes or names or placenames) into explicit numeric locations (usually Lat Long coordinates) that can be further manipulated by computational systems, for routing, analysis, or just viewing on a map.

Stanford Libraries' locator.stanford.edu service deploys 250+GB of Parcel, Street, POI & Administrative Boundary Data, including street address-level data for 149 countries that covers more than 90% of the world's population. These data are accessible nateively through ArcGIS Pro, as well as programmatically, through a REST API that makes it possible to comsume the locator services from platforms like R, Python and even QGIS. 

This workshop will introduce the participatnt to several types of geocoding, through several plafroms.

Topics will include:

* An overview of Geocoding terminology and concepts
* An overview of the services available from locator.stanford.edu
* An overview of the utility of geocoded data
* Hands-on experience and demonstrations using locator.stanford.edu from a number of platforms, including:
 * ArcGIS Pro
 * OpenRefine
 * QGIS
 * Python Notebooks
 * R

_Guidelines for image files_

   * File type must be a JPEG or PNG.
   * The recommended image size is at least 2160 x 1080px.
   * The width to length ratio should be 2:1. This means your event image should be a horizontal image that is twice as wide as it is tall. You can crop your image when you upload it.
   * Image file must be no larger than 10MB.
   * You must own the images you upload or have permission from the copyright holder to use them.

_Best Practices_

   * Photos should be, at a minimum, 940 x 557px
   * Rectangular photos will translate better than square photos in Localist
   * Use non-text-heavy photos as there are multiple viewpoints they’ll be referenced
   * If you must use text-heavy photos, aim for the text to be as close to the center of the image as possible.
   * Aim for photos without too much white space for a better end-look
